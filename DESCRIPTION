Description: Quantifies ecological memory functions for a subset 
    of covariates within a linear or generalized linear model 
    using penalized splines. Ecological memory functions 
    indicate the length of persistent responses and the 
    relative importance of past environmental conditions of 
    current ecosystem function. Memory functions are used to 
    generate weighted covariate values reflecting the 
    cumulative effect of environmental conditions over time. 
    Functions accept continuous, count, and proportional 
    response data and continous as well as binary (e.g., event 
    data) covariate observations. Memory functions, regression 
    coefficients, and residual error parameters are estimated 
    as part of a Bayesian hierarchical model, which utilizes 
    Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to sample from 
    the joint posterior distibution.
